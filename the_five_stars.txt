Got a doll baby, I love her so
Nothing else like her anywhere you go
Man she's anything but calm
A regular pint-sized atom bomb

Atom bomb baby little atom bomb
I want her in my wigwam
She's just the way I want her to be
A million times hotter than TNT

Atom bomb baby, loaded with power
Radioactive as a TV tower
A nuclear fission in her soul
Loves with electronic control

Atom bomb baby little atom bomb
I want her in my wigwam
She's just the way I want her to be
A million times hotter than TNT

Atom bomb baby, boy she can start
One of those chain reactions in my heart
A big explosion, big and loud
Mushrooms me right up on a cloud

Atom bomb baby little atom bomb
I want her in my wigwam
She's just the way I want her to be
A million times hotter than TNT
Atom bomb baby, sweet as a plum
Carries more whallop than uranium
When she kisses, there's no hitch
Zero power she turns on a switch

Atom bomb baby little atom bomb
I want her in my wigwam
She's just the way I want her to be
A million times hotter than TNT
